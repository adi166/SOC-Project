# SOC Project

## Introduction
- In todayâ€™s fast-changing cybersecurity domain, strong Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are more important than ever. As cyber threats grow more advanced, organizations must improve their detection and response to protect their data and assets.
One way to sharpen these skills is by building a fully automated SOC home lab. This project simplifies the process, showing how to set up a lab using open-source tools.

## Objective
- The SOC home lab aims to provide hands-on experience in setting up and managing a simulated Security Operations Center.
- It helps users familiarize themselves with open-source tools like Wazuh for alerts, Shuffle for SOAR, and TheHive for case management.
- The lab also offers training in incident detection, analysis, and response, while teaching integration of tools to improve efficiency.
- Also, it includes threat intelligence using services like VirusTotal to enhance the analysis of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

### Skills Learned
- SOC Setup and Management: Learn how to setup, confihure and operate SOC in your own environment.
- Learn Tools: Get experience with open-source tools like Wazuh, Shuffle and TheHive for alerting, automation, and case management.
- Integration: Learn how to use and integrate different tools together.
- Handling IOCs: ................


### Tools Used
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine.
- Wazuh
- Shuffle
- TheHive
